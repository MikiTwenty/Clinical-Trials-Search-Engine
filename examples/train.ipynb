One of the most common antibiotics used\\r\\n      to treat UTIs is Trimethoprim-sulfa (TMP-SMX), usually for total of three days.

The effectiveness of fosfomycin in curing UTIs when given as a single dose is not\\r\\n      well studied. The purpose of this research study is to determine what the cure rates are with\\r\\n      a single dose of fosfomycin versus the more standard 3-day course of TMP-SMX.
